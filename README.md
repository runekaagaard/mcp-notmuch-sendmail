Let Claude be your email assistant! MCP Notmuch Sendmail connects Claude Desktop to your notmuch email database, allowing it to:

- Search and browse your email threads
- View conversations in a clean text format
- Compose new emails using markdown
- Reply to threads with smart deduplication of quoted content
- Create beautiful emails with LaTeX-inspired styling

Uses html2text for HTML email rendering and markdown-it for composing rich HTML emails with inline images.
